# openinfo — code map

**Status:** Phases 0–2 built + P3 in progress (contracts · seam · distill/moments/index · sessions · HUD · act · fabric profiles/secrets · the Settings sidebar at GET /settings (Status·Get-started·Endpoints·Profiles·Keys·Local-runtimes·Features·HUD-layout·Benchmarks·Try-it·Privacy; /setup 301s here) · onboarding discovery + Get-Started lens · the "watch it become a moment" Try-it loop · engine-managed local runtimes / tier zero · client system-audio capture (BlackHole detect-and-guide)) · 2026-07-08
**Reads with:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (the what) · [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) (the when)
This file is the **where** — including where features that don't exist yet will land, so no later phase ever
has to invent a home (the historical failure mode).

## 2. Dependency rules (the ones that prevent the refactor spiral)

1. `apps/*` depend on `shared/contracts` and **nothing else in the repo**. Client never imports engine;
   workbench never imports either — they meet only at the API.
2. Only `engine/store` opens a database handle. `route/` asks store to move a session; `index/` asks store to
   write an entity. Workspace isolation is enforced by one module, so it cannot be reached around.
3. `templates/` contains no code. If a template "needs" code, a block type is missing — add it to the engine
   and keep the template a document.
4. `spikes/` is not a workspace package and is banned from imports (CI-enforced). Spikes graduate by being
   **rewritten** under `apps/` against contracts — never copy-pasted.
5. New feature → find its row in §3. If it has no row, it gets a design note in ARCHITECTURE.md *before* code.

## 3. Where future features land (so nothing invents a home later)

| Future feature | Phase | Home |
|---|---|---|
| Camera input (presence → doc capture) | P7 | `client/capture/camera.ts` + flag `capture.camera` |
| System-audio native tap (no user routing) | future | `client/capture/audio-tap/` — a CoreAudio process-tap / ScreenCaptureKit-audio native module (macOS 14.2+), written from source under review (route (b), ARCHITECTURE §8). Drops behind the same source-agnostic capture controller/protocol/chunk path built in the BlackHole slice — swaps only *how the 2nd stream opens*. A trustworthy prebuilt module (route (c)) is its shortcut; the inherited SystemAudioDump blob (d) stays rejected (fresh code only) |
| Diarization / voice→person | P7 | `engine/route/identity.ts` + `fabric` stt option |
| Google Docs pin ingestion (auth) | P3 | `engine/index/ingest/gdoc.ts` + flag `ingest.gdoc` |
| Gmail/calendar write scopes | P7+ | new `engine/connect/` module (design note first, per rule 5) |
| Cloud endpoints (Gemini Live, Anthropic) | P7 | `engine/fabric/endpoints/cloud.ts` (keychain) |
| Fabric profiles + secrets (this slice) | P2 | `engine/fabric/{profiles,secrets}.ts` + profile/secret routes; live fabric = active profile |
| Settings sidebar (models/pipeline/surfaces/diagnostics) | P3 (built) | `engine/surfaces/settings/` — GET /settings, ENGINE-served SIDEBAR shell over a section registry (Status · Get started · Endpoints · Profiles · Keys · Local runtimes · Features · HUD layout · Benchmarks · Try it · Privacy). A sidebar redesign of the old one-page /setup, which 301s here. Re-homes the setup/ pure fns behind the registry. No new engine capability. |
| First-run / fabric setup (forms over profile+secret docs) | P2 (built) | `engine/surfaces/setup/view.ts` — pure fabric/profile/keys fragments, now re-homed into the Settings Endpoints/Profiles/Keys sections (served by the engine, opened in the browser; the tray opens /settings). No new engine capability. |
| Feature composition UI (flags) | P3 (built) | Settings → Features (`engine/surfaces/settings/sections/features.ts`) — every seeded flag as a human-named, stage-grouped toggle with dependency notes, flipping the EXISTING `PUT /flags/:key`. The six real gating flags are seeded from `shared/contracts/examples/flag.examples.json` via `ensureDefaultFlags` (the vision-b "enable/disable for all combinations" affordance). No new engine capability. |
| Onboarding discovery + Get-Started lens | P2 (built) | `engine/fabric/discover.ts` + probe-list/capability-map seed docs; `GET /fabric/discover` (DiscoverResult); the capability lens + one-button "Use this setup" is now Settings → Get started (`engine/surfaces/setup/view.ts`, composes the existing profile routes — no new write semantics) |
| Say-something verification loop (slice b) | P2 (built) | Settings → Try it (`engine/surfaces/setup/view.ts`) — "type/speak → watch it become a moment", live off the `moment.created` WS event. Engine-served browser page (the browser owns the `getUserMedia` mic prompt; works for the remote-engine workflow too). Composes existing routes only (flags/sessions/capture/WS) — no new engine capability |
| Engine-managed local runtimes / tier zero (slice c) | P2 (built) | `engine/fabric/endpoints/local.ts` (`LocalRuntimeManager`: discover binary + spawn/ready/health/kill/bounded-restart for llama.cpp/whisper.cpp) + `local-models.ts` (download/resume/size-check) + `local-{documents,defaults}.ts` (starter catalog). invoke/health ride `local` on the existing seams (llm reuses the http chat path; stt speaks whisper.cpp's `/inference`). Routes `GET /fabric/local/models` + `POST /fabric/local/download`; the nothing-found lens offers "Download a starter model" → writes a `local` endpoint into config-1 via the existing profile routes. mlx/ollama/paddle/coreml are future specs (CONTRIBUTING recipe) |
| Invoke resilience + honest errors | P3 (built) | `engine/fabric/invoke-error.ts` (`InvokeError` taxonomy: unreachable · timeout · auth · model-load · bad-response · reasoning-exhausted — each with a troubleshoot hint; `AggregateInvokeError` keeps the classes through fall-through) + `diagnose.ts` (classify a drain throw → `QueueFailure`, enrich a model-load hint with the loaded-model suggestion via `discover.ts` `listLoadedModels`, read-only). `GET /queue` (`QueueStatus` + `lastFailure`/`lastSuccessAt`, drain state in-memory on the CaptureQueue). `POST /fabric/test` `probe:'generate'` runs a REAL 1-token completion (the ping-lied fix; `EndpointProbe.generate`). Try-it three-truths = pure `setup/view.ts` `tryItDiagnosis` reading `GET /queue`. Status shows the classified last failure. No auto-switch (user agency). |
| Host-scan + model dropdown (Endpoints editor) | P3 (built) | `engine/fabric/scan.ts` (`scanHosts`: exact-url, or bare-host × the probe-list DOCUMENT's ports; models classified via the capability map; failures in the invoke taxonomy's classes; a 401/403 = reachable+authRequired; fresh per call, value-free) + `POST /fabric/scan` (`ScanRequest`/`ScanResult`). The Endpoints editor's per-row **Scan** button turns the free-text model field into a grouped dropdown (slot-matching models first, capability chips, a custom… escape hatch), renders the per-host capabilities summary ("30 chat · 4 ocr · 2 embed"), highlights the keyRef selector on authRequired, and offers "scan common ports on <host>" for a bare host / dead URL. Pure decisions in `setup/view.ts`, mirrored by the browser script. |
| LAN sweep discovery (with permission) | future | `engine/fabric/discover.ts` — a consent-gated subnet sweep (cross-host rigs). Blocked on macOS Local-Network TCC (GUI-domain LaunchAgent; see ARCHITECTURE §8 platform note) |
| macOS Keychain secret store | P7 | `engine/fabric/secrets.ts` — `KeychainSecretStore` behind the `SecretStore` interface (drop-in for the v0 file) |
| Drift steering (comparator + chains) | P5 | `engine/voice/{comparator,chains}.ts`; card/glyph = HUD blocks |
| TTS whisper (chain terminus) | P5 | `fabric` tts slot + chain step `tts` |
| Explore canvas (lenses, branches) | P6 | `workbench/explore/` + `engine/surfaces/custom-blocks.ts` |
| Palette designer (buttons, input toggles) | P6 | `client/surfaces/palette/` over action documents |
| Surface WYSIWYG / mode canvas / dial editor | P6 | `client/surfaces/editor/` — forms over documents, no new engine capability allowed |
| Backlog analytics surface | P7 | `workbench/analytics/` reading `engine/queue/eta` |
| Custom user blocks (HTML, sandboxed) | P6 | `engine/surfaces/custom-blocks.ts` + client webview host |
| Mobile / second-screen readouts | unplanned | a new `apps/*` consumer of the same API — the seam already permits it |
| Rust hot paths (if ever needed) | unplanned | replace an engine module behind its contract; `shared/contracts/schemas/` is the port surface |

## 4. Spikes — what they are and how they bend the plan

A **spike** is a throwaway proof that answers exactly one question, in hours, in `spikes/`, with none of the
production rules applied (hardcode anything, skip types, no tests). It is deleted or graduated-by-rewrite;
its output is an *answer*, recorded as a paragraph in the relevant phase doc.

Standing spike list (each retires a named risk from IMPLEMENTATION §5):

| Spike | Question | Retires |
|---|---|---|
| `seam-echo` | client on machine A → engine on machine B, capture round-trip + offline spool | P1 risk |
| `glass-capture` | does glass's mic/screen/audio transplant build on current macOS/Electron? | P1 risk |
| `extract-quality` | record 10 min of a real meeting (fixtures tool), run 3 local models over the moment/entity schemas — which is usable? | P2 risk |
| `delta-gate` | screenshot Δ-diff: threshold vs OCR cost on real screen activity | P2/P3 |
| `register-detect` | can a small model score detected charm/wit vs the dial scale at all? | P5 risk |
| `sandbox-bridge` | postMessage API-allowlist webview: can a custom block be both useful and contained? | P6 |

### The honest recalibration you asked for

You're right: the first slice is **hours, not days**. The 6-month figure in IMPLEMENTATION.md conflates two
different clocks, and it's worth splitting them permanently:

- **Construction time** — writing the code. With agent-driven development this compresses ~10×: the Phase 1
  seam is a day-or-two build; the Phase 2 HUD vertical is a week-scale build, not six.
- **Convergence time** — the part that does not compress: dogfooding against *real* workdays. Extraction
  quality, router attribution, register detection, drift thresholds — these are tuned against lived meetings,
  and a week of calendar time contains only a week of meetings. Exit criteria like "attend a real meeting,
  trust the ledger" are experiential, not constructional.

Revised expectation per phase: **demo-able in days, trustworthy in weeks.** The phase *order* and *exit
criteria* in IMPLEMENTATION.md stand unchanged — what changes is that construction stops being the bottleneck
after week one, and the critical path becomes fixture data + dogfood cycles. That is why `tools/fixtures`
(record a meeting once, replay it deterministically) is in the tree at P0-priority: it converts convergence
time into regression tests and is the single highest-leverage tool in the repo.

Practical cadence this implies: run spikes `seam-echo`, `glass-capture`, and `extract-quality` in the first
days (they are cheap and they de-risk the two riskiest phases before any production code hardens); build
Phases 0–2 as fast as agents allow; then let the calendar do what only it can — accumulate real sessions —
while construction runs ahead on Phases 3–4 behind flags.
